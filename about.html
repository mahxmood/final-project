        <p>hi there! i'm mahmood sadeghi, a computer science student at northwestern university. i've been passionate about technology and music for as long as i can remember. i am really passionate about exploring new music and connecting with people through this art form. besides coding, i like djing, partying, reading (but like actually), making tik toks, and going out for sweet treats with friends. fun fact: sza has been my top apple music artist for the last 5 years or so!</p>

        <p>if you don't find me walking around campus with my headphones blasting music into my ears, you'll likely find me at a live music event. whether it's a concert, a festival, or a rave, i thrive in the energy of live performances. there's something magical about experiencing music with a crowd, and it's one of my favorite ways to unwind and connect with others. music is more than just a hobby for me—it's a way of life!
