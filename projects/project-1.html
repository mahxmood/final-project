      <h1>brat - charli xcx</h1>
      <p class="justification">released in june 2024, charli xcx's most recent album, brat, is a daring and exuberant examination of her artistic journey that combines the raw, edgy sounds of the underground club scene with her electro-pop origins. on the album, charli returns to her hyper-pop, pre-mainstream influences. songs like "von dutch" and "360" encapsulate the exuberant, party-ready spirit that has characterized a lot of her work. these songs are instant summer hits because of their slick production and self-referential lyrics. but brat is more than simply club bangers and fast-paced sounds. additionally, charli explores more delicate and intimate areas. the album gains emotional depth from songs like "so i," which pays homage to her late collaborator sophie, and "i think about it all the time," in which she muses about becoming a mother and her future. this blend of danceable tracks and unadulterated emotion demonstrates charli's ability to stretch the boundaries of pop music while maintaining her distinctive artistic voice.</p>
