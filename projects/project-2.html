      <h1>submarine - the marias</h1>
      <p class="justification">submarine, the second studio album by the marías, released in may 2024, is a deeply atmospheric and emotionally rich project that explores themes of isolation, heartbreak, and personal reflection. the album marks a progression from their previous work, cinema, with a sound that is both familiar and evolved, blending lush, dreamy instrumentals with new sonic experiments.

        throughout submarine, the band navigates a diverse range of musical styles, from the trance-like electronic beats of "run your mouth" to the cinematic and jazz-infused "real life." maría zardoya's vocals, delivered in both english and spanish, add an intimate and haunting quality to the tracks, particularly in songs like "blur" and "sienna." the album maintains a cohesive yet experimental feel, with aquatic and dreamy elements woven throughout, making it a standout release that showcases the marías' growth and versatility as artists.</p>
